#IotaTemp_basic

Wemos D1 mini and SHT30 Sensor logs to the internet. The older DHT12 is also supported if you have one handy.

Uses a Wemos/Lolin D1 mini hooked up to the Wemos DHT v3.0.0 shield that logs temp and humidity up to an EmonCMS server.

You can create your own EmonCMS server, the code is open source or create an account at emoncms.org. If you decide to use AWS, pro tip: Reserved Instances are your friend.

Create a local data.h and substitute your values as shown in the ino file.

Once you have an account, substitute the values in the #data.h recompile and upload.

Your values should appear in emoncms/inputs almost immediately.
